# Most-Popular-Franchise-Disclosure-Documents
A program to show an interested franchisee the most popular FDDs on the market. I came into an already built database with just strings of 
the document ID's and I needed a way to see which 4 FDD's were being downloaded the most. 

So with the way the database is set up I had to cut up the strings and transfter arrays.  It was a fun project and worked out nicely.

I like this program because it has a little of everthing web.  Php, Mysql, JavaScript, AJAX, jQuery, HTML and CSS.  
I am not including the database class but as you can imnagine it simply connects to the database.
